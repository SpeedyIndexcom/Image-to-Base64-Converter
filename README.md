## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Converter Tool

The primary tool is located at [`/image-to-base-converter.html`](https://image-to-base64-converter-eight.vercel.app/image-to-base-converter.html).

### 1. Image/PDF to Base64 Conversion:
    a. Click the "Choose File" button under the "Image/PDF to Base64" section.
    b. Select an image file (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, `.gif`) or a `.pdf` file from your device.
    c. The Base64 encoded string will automatically appear in the "Base64 Output" textarea.
    d. If an image file was uploaded, a preview will be shown.
    e. Click the "Copy Base64" button to copy the string to your clipboard.

### 2. Base64 to Image (or PDF-Page to Image) Conversion:
    a. Paste your Base64 string into the "Base64 Input" textarea under the "Base64 to Image" section.
       *   For images, the string should typically start with `data:image/png;base64,...`, `data:image/jpeg;base64,...`, etc.
       *   For PDFs, the string should start with `data:application/pdf;base64,...`.
    b. Click the "Show Image" button.
    c. The decoded image (or the first page of the PDF as an image) will be displayed in the preview area.
    d. A "Download Image" button will appear, allowing you to save the displayed image (typically as a `.png`).

## üìÇ Project Structure (Simplified)

The website consists of several static HTML pages:

*   `index.html`: The main landing page for PicsArtHub.app, introducing the site and its offerings.
*   `image-to-base-converter.html`: The core tool for all Base64 conversions.
*   `image-indexing.html`: An informational page explaining image indexing and common image formats.
*   `about.html`: Information about the PicsArtHub.app project.
*   `contact.html`: Contact information.
*   `guides.html`: Placeholder for future guides and tutorials.
*   `developer-resources.html`: Placeholder for future developer-specific resources.
*   (Potentially `privacy-policy.html` and `terms-of-service.html`)

Styling and client-side JavaScript for interactivity are included within these HTML files or can be linked externally (e.g., `style.css`, `script.js`).

## üíª Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages.
*   **CSS3:** For styling (including CSS Variables for theming).
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For all client-side logic, interactivity, and the conversion processes.
*   **PDF.js (by Mozilla):** A JavaScript library used to parse and render PDF files from Base64 data into an image canvas.
*   **Vercel:** For hosting and deployment of this static site.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Potential Ideas)

*   Support for more input/output image formats.
*   Batch processing for multiple images.
*   Ability to fetch an image from a URL for conversion.
*   Option to select a specific page number for PDF to image conversion.
*   Dark mode / Theme switcher.
*   Advanced options for Base64 output (e.g., without data URI prefix).
*   Development of actual guides and developer resources.

## üìÑ License

This project is typically for personal use and demonstration. If the source code were to be shared, a license (e.g., MIT License) would be specified.
